WebPonize is a Mac OS App for converting images into [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/).

2. Extract downloaded webponize.tar.gz.

4. Just drag and drop your images into WebPonize!

If you want to know about WebP, try the article "[Introduction to WebP](http://bit.ly/introduction-to-webp)" which I wrote up on Medium.
